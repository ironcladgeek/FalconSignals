## Quick Rules of Thumb

### Value Investing (Buffett-style)
- ROE consistently >15%
- P/E <20 (or reasonable vs growth)
- Profit margin >10%
- Low debt (<50% debt-to-equity)

### Growth Investing
- Revenue growth >20% YoY
- PEG <1.5
- High ROE (>20%)
- Can tolerate higher P/E if growth justifies it

### Red Flags 🚩
- Negative or declining profit margins
- ROE <10% for multiple years
- Revenue growing but earnings shrinking
- P/E >40 without strong growth story
- Debt-to-equity >3

## Context Matters!

- **Tech/SaaS**: Naturally higher P/S (5-15), lower P/B, high margins (20-40%)
- **Retail/Industrials**: Lower P/S (0.5-2), lower margins (3-10%)
- **Banks/Insurance**: P/B more relevant, lower P/E (8-15)
- **Growth Stage**: May have negative earnings, focus on revenue growth & margins
- **Mature Companies**: Lower P/E (10-20), steady dividends, focus on ROE & cash flow

**Remember**: No single metric tells the whole story. Compare companies within the same industry and look at trends over 3-5 years, not just snapshots.
